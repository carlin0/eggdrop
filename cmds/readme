### Moduli per script helpsys


SETUP
    1. Create a directory to store help files (using eggdrop's help directory is not recommended)
    2. For each help "topic" create a file that will be read when the user requests it
       NOTE: Step 1 & 2 must be done BEFORE loading the script, if it is not, the script will
       return an error and not load
    3. Read and edit the configuration section of commands.tcl
    4. Add the line "source scripts/commands.tcl" to your eggdrop conf
    5. Rehash

USAGE
    The file matched up with the "main" topic will be sent to the user if no topic is specified,
    otherwise, the specified topic is searched for and the coresponding file is sent. Command
    syntax for the help commands are !help [topic] or /msg BOT help [topic].

EXAMPLE
    variable dir "commands/"

    variable topics {
        main    main.help
        google  google.help
    }

    User input: !help
    Result: commands/main.help is sent line-by-line to the user

    User input: !help google
    Result: commands/google.help is sent to the user
